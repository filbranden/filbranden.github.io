I started with the single simple wish to use GitHub Pages to create a

It ended up with me creating my own Jekyll theme and
[writing Ruby code](https://github.com/jekyll/github-metadata/pull/151)
to expose additional metadata in GitHub Pages!

Follow me in my adventure exploring the Jekyll template engine.
