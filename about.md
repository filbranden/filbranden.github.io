## About Me

I'm just a Linux Plumber üë®‚Äçüîß. I really enjoy the plumbing it takes to
create a rich userspace starting from the low-level Linux kernel APIs.

I'm an active contributor to the [systemd](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/)
project. I really enjoy the low-level container infrastructure (cgroups and
namespaces) and my recent interests are into enabling cgroup v2 into the Golang
container libraries (such as libcontainer.) Some of my other interests in this
area are Linux capabilities and SELinux.

I have a lot of experience with Linux distributions, particularly packaging
software and managing distributions through software packages. Recently I
have become an official packager at Fedora project and I have done quite a
bit of work on `.deb`s at my day job.

I have a recent interest in web design (prompted by my wish to create this
personal website), so I have been working on Jekyll themes and learning a lot
of CSS/JavaScript.

This is brought to you by the power of Markdown and the amazing Jekyll engine!
